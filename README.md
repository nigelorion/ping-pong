## "Spec" Sheet

  * _It will take the user input value and create an array counting to the length entered. Example: input = 3 output = [1, 2, 3]_
  * _It will check for conditions as it is building the array. If one of the conditions is met it will convert that to a predefined string. Otherwise it will place the number at that position Example: input = 3 output = [1, 2, Ping] or Input = 5 output = [1,2,Ping,4,Pong]_
  * _It will then take that array and give it a new variable name Example: input = userArray output = pingPong_
  * _It will star a forEach loop to apply li tags to each element in the array and append it to a predefined ul element in the HTML Example: input = [1,2,Pong] output = li 1 /li li 2 /li li Ping /li_
